# Project Management: Current Branch To-Do List

branch ruleEngine is a more focused 'attempt II' of branch organise. it is more incremental approach.  I separated app.js into multiple files and focused on extracting the index.js API responcible for rule integration.  Most changes are contained in the src folder.  The remaining file structure has been reorganised, but remains mainly the same

## Refactoring & Improvements

1. **Security Review:**  
   Ensure no sensitive schema details (table/column names) are exposed to the UI or external clients.

2. **Refactor for Maintainability:**  
   Refactor the switch statement in `fieldUpdates.js` into a mapping object or modular functions to reduce repetition and improve scalability.

3. **Unit/Integration Tests:**  
   Write tests for the update logic, especially for cases with complex or cascading updates.

4. **Expand Documentation:**  
   Continue updating documentation for new fieldIDs, workflow rules, and edge cases.

5. **Workflow Logic:**  
   Review and enhance the `ruleEngine` and workflow automation, ensuring all supported rules are documented and robust.

6. **Error Handling & Logging:**  
   Standardize error responses and logging for easier debugging and auditing.
