The PERMIT folder in Dropbox, Amandah & Alexs creation is what we are aiming to capture and maybe recreate but it is the foundation of what we want to capture and have functioning in OUR programme 


This is a concept of a user pays per visit product.  Victoria only
Amandah has created a calculator for permits and with a discussion with her, you might freshen it up to be a working part of our programme or a separate sale item – user pays per visit.  This one needs to be dealt with carefully, so don’t rush at it just yet.  
There is a mob called Fernleigh that have this type of thing, but it is very limited and they don’t offer their service in Victoria

Other creations of Amanah’s might also fit with freshen ups, 
Job register that they use
Funds in Holding account
Cost record for a task
Job journal but better job costing
